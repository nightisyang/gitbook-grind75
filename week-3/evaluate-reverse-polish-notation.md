# Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation" %}

### Problem

> Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in [Reverse Polish Notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse\_Polish\_notation).
>
> Valid operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
>
> **Note** that division between two integers should truncate toward zero.
>
> It is guaranteed that the given RPN expression is always valid. That means the expression would always evaluate to a result, and there will not be any division by zero operation.
>
> &#x20;
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> <pre><code>Input: tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]
> <strong>Output: 9
> </strong><strong>Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9</strong></code></pre>
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> <pre><code>Input: tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]
> <strong>Output: 6
> </strong><strong>Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6</strong></code></pre>
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> <pre><code>Input: tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]
> <strong>Output: 22
> </strong><strong>Explanation:
> </strong> ((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
> = ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
> = ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
> = ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
> = (0 + 17) + 5
> = 17 + 5
> = 22</code></pre>
