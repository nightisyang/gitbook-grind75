# Insert Interval

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval" %}

### Problem

> You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` represent the start and the end of the `ith` interval and `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by `starti`. You are also given an interval `newInterval = [start, end]` that represents the start and end of another interval.
>
> Insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that `intervals` is still sorted in ascending order by `starti` and `intervals` still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).
>
> Return `intervals` _after the insertion_.
>
> &#x20;
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> <pre><code>Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
> <strong>Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]</strong></code></pre>
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> <pre><code>Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
> <strong>Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
> </strong><strong>Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].</strong></code></pre>
