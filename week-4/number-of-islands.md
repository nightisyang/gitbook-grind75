### Problem

> Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.
>
> An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
>
> &#x20;
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> <pre><code>Input: grid = [
>   ["1","1","1","1","0"],
>   ["1","1","0","1","0"],
>   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
>   ["0","0","0","0","0"]
> ]
> <strong>Output: 1</strong></code></pre>
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> <pre><code>Input: grid = [
>   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
>   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
>   ["0","0","1","0","0"],
>   ["0","0","0","1","1"]
> ]
> <strong>Output: 3</strong></code></pre>
