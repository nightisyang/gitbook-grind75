# Rotting Oranges

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges" %}

### Problem

> You are given an `m x n` `grid` where each cell can have one of three values:
>
> * `0` representing an empty cell,
> * `1` representing a fresh orange, or
> * `2` representing a rotten orange.
>
> Every minute, any fresh orange that is **4-directionally adjacent** to a rotten orange becomes rotten.
>
> Return _the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange_. If _this is impossible, return_ `-1`.
>
> &#x20;
>
> **Example 1:**

> ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/16/oranges.png)
>
> <pre><code>Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
> <strong>Output: 4</strong></code></pre>
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> <pre data-overflow="wrap"><code>Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
> <strong>Output: -1
> </strong><strong>Explanation: The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.</strong></code></pre>
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> <pre data-overflow="wrap"><code>Input: grid = [[0,2]]
> <strong>Output: 0
> </strong><strong>Explanation: Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.</strong></code></pre>
