# Validate Binary Search Tree

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree" %}

### Problem

> Given the `root` of a binary tree, _determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST)_.
>
> A **valid BST** is defined as follows:
>
> * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
> * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
> * Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
>

>
> **Example 1:**

>
> <pre><code>Input: root = [2,1,3]
> <strong>Output: true</strong></code></pre>
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/01/tree2.jpg)
>
> <pre><code>Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
> <strong>Output: false
> </strong><strong>Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.</strong></code></pre>
