# Combination Sum

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum" %}

### Problem

> Given an array of **distinct** integers `candidates` and a target integer `target`, return _a list of all **unique combinations** of_ `candidates` _where the chosen numbers sum to_ `target`_._ You may return the combinations in **any order**.
>
> The **same** number may be chosen from `candidates` an **unlimited number of times**. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.
>
> The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to `target` is less than `150` combinations for the given input.
>
> &#x20;
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> <pre><code>Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
> <strong>Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
> </strong><strong>Explanation:
> </strong>2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
> 7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
> These are the only two combinations.</code></pre>
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> <pre><code>Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
> <strong>Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]</strong></code></pre>
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> <pre><code>Input: candidates = [2], target = 1
> <strong>Output: []</strong></code></pre>
