{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals" %}

### Problem

> Given an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return _an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input_.
>
> &#x20;
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> <pre><code>Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
> <strong>Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
> </strong><strong>Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].</strong></code></pre>
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> <pre><code>Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
> <strong>Output: [[1,5]]
> </strong><strong>Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.</strong></code></pre>
