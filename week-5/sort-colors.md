{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors" %}

### Problem

> Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place\_algorithm) **** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
>
> We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.
>
> You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.
>
> &#x20;
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> <pre><code>Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
> <strong>Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]</strong></code></pre>
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> <pre><code>Input: nums = [2,0,1]
> <strong>Output: [0,1,2]</strong></code></pre>
