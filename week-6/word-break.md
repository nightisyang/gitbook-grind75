{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break" %}

### Problem

> Given a string `s` and a dictionary of strings `wordDict`, return `true` if `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.
>
> **Note** that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
>
> &#x20;
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> <pre><code>Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
> <strong>Output: true
> </strong><strong>Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".</strong></code></pre>
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> <pre><code>Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
> <strong>Output: true
> </strong><strong>Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
> </strong>Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.</code></pre>
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> <pre><code>Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
