### Problem

> You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.
>
> Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
>
> Return _the maximum amount of water a container can store_.
>
> **Notice** that you may not slant the container.

> <pre data-overflow="wrap"><code>Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
> <strong>Output: 49
> </strong><strong>Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.</strong></code></pre>

> **Example 2:**
>
> <pre><code>Input: height = [1,1]
> <strong>Output: 1</strong></code></pre>
