# Find All Anagrams in a String

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string" %}

### Problem

> Given two strings `s` and `p`, return _an array of all the start indices of_ `p`_'s anagrams in_ `s`. You may return the answer in **any order**.
>
> An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.
>

>
> **Example 1:**
>
> <pre><code>Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
> <strong>Output: [0,6]
> </strong><strong>Explanation:
> </strong>The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
> The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".</code></pre>
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> <pre><code>Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
> <strong>Output: [0,1,2]
> </strong><strong>Explanation:
> </strong>The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
> The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
> The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".</code></pre>
