# Maximum Profit in Job Scheduling

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-profit-in-job-scheduling" %}

### Problem

> We have `n` jobs, where every job is scheduled to be done from `startTime[i]` to `endTime[i]`, obtaining a profit of `profit[i]`.
>
> You're given the `startTime`, `endTime` and `profit` arrays, return the maximum profit you can take such that there are no two jobs in the subset with overlapping time range.
>
> If you choose a job that ends at time `X` you will be able to start another job that starts at time `X`.
>
> &#x20;
>
> **Example 1:**

>
> <pre><code>Input: startTime = [1,2,3,3], endTime = [3,4,5,6], profit = [50,10,40,70]
> <strong>Output: 120
> </strong><strong>Explanation: The subset chosen is the first and fourth job. 
> </strong>Time range [1-3]+[3-6] , we get profit of 120 = 50 + 70.</code></pre>

> <pre><code>Input: startTime = [1,2,3,4,6], endTime = [3,5,10,6,9], profit = [20,20,100,70,60]
> <strong>Output: 150
> </strong><strong>Explanation:
> </strong>The subset chosen is the first, fourth and fifth job. 
> Profit obtained 150 = 20 + 70 + 60.</code></pre>
>
> **Example 3:**

> <pre><code>Input: startTime = [1,1,1], endTime = [2,3,4], profit = [5,6,4]
> <strong>Output: 6</strong></code></pre>
