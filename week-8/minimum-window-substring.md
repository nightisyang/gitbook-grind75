# Minimum Window Substring

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring" %}

### Problem

> Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return _the **minimum window**_ _**substring** of_ `s` _such that every character in_ `t` _(**including duplicates**) is included in the window_. If there is no such substring, return _the empty string_ `""`.
>
> The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.
>
> &#x20;
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> <pre data-overflow="wrap"><code>Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
> <strong>Output: "BANC"
> </strong><strong>Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.</strong></code></pre>
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> <pre><code>Input: s = "a", t = "a"
> <strong>Output: "a"
> </strong><strong>Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.</strong></code></pre>
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> <pre><code>Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
> <strong>Output: ""
> </strong><strong>Explanation:
> </strong>Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
> Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.</code></pre>
