# Word Ladder

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder" %}

### Problem

> A **transformation sequence** from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a dictionary `wordList` is a sequence of words `beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk` such that:
>
> * Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
> * Every `si` for `1 <= i <= k` is in `wordList`. Note that `beginWord` does not need to be in `wordList`.
> * `sk == endWord`
>
> Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return _the **number of words** in the **shortest transformation sequence** from_ `beginWord` _to_ `endWord`_, or_ `0` _if no such sequence exists._

> **Example 1:**
>
> <pre data-overflow="wrap"><code>Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
> <strong>Output: 5
> </strong><strong>Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.</strong></code></pre>
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> <pre data-overflow="wrap"><code>Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
> <strong>Output: 0
> </strong><strong>Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.</strong></code></pre>
